<h1> Some extremely handy tips to help with other questions</h1>
<h2>Finding the nth term</h2>
<p>Finding the nth term can be extremely frustrating.<br>Basically, let's say you have find the nth term of <br>6,11,16,21. Goes up by 5 everytime doesn't it? <br>So we have 5n so far. Hey! You know the first<br> number in the sequence? Yeah 6. Take 6 away<br> from 5. (1). So it is 5n + 1
<h2>Write the name of this part of a circle</h2>
<p>I highly suggest going <a href = "http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/diameter-of-circle.html"> here</a> to find all of the circle names with the one you require.</p>
<h2>Ratios</h2>
<p>Let's say you gotta split 63 into the ratio 3:4. Add 3 and 4. (7). Now divide 63 into 7 (9). Now do 9 * 3 (27) and 9 * 4 (36). So the ratio is 27:36.</p>
